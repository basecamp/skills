# Basecamp Doctor

Run the structured diagnostic:

```bash
basecamp doctor --json
```

Interpret every check by status:

- `pass`: working correctly.
- `warn`: usable, but follow-up is recommended.
- `skip`: not run because it is unauthenticated or not applicable.
- `fail`: broken and needs attention.

Report failures and warnings with their `hint` fields. Also inspect the top-level `breadcrumbs` array and preserve its structured `cmd` next steps, because a breadcrumb can provide a more specific action than a check hint. Use these common remediations when relevant:

- Basecamp authentication: `basecamp auth login`
- Agent plugin installation or version: `basecamp setup`
- Skill + all detected agents, non-interactively: `basecamp setup agents` (honors `BASECAMP_SETUP_AGENT`)
- Codex plugin specifically: `basecamp setup codex`
- Claude Code plugin specifically: `basecamp setup claude`

Do not read, print, or request credential files. If every check passes, say that Basecamp and its agent integration are ready.
